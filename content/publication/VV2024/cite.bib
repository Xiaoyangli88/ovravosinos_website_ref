abstract = {The lattice-theoretic approach has had a significant impact in all fields of economics, being progressively incorporated into the standard toolbox. This paper presents a selective survey with an emphasis on basic tools, some important results, and applications in industrial organization, dynamic games, games of incomplete information, and mechanism design. Frontier theoretical research employing lattice-theoretic methods continues to be developed in areas such as mean-field games and information design.}
